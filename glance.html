                  can channel
                  competitive instincts in a positive way. For
                  example, asking children to build a robot from a Lego set and then running a race to see which Robot
                  goes fastest
                  works well. It is one of the most engaging ways of introducing IT in the curriculum.</li>


                <li>Effective Way of Introducing Programming to Students
                  Programming can be too abstract. By having to control a physical robot and seeing what goes wrong,
                  students learn
                  what robots can and cannot do. They also learn the need for precise instructions.</li>

                <li class="bg-warning">Provides Skills Useful In Future Employment
                  There is no doubt that there will be a need for people to be involved in programming mechanical
                  devices in the
                  foreseeable future.</li>

                <li>Suitable For Children with a Range of Abilities
                  There is considerable evidence that robots are particularly suitable for engaging with children on the
                  autism
                  spectrum. Children on the spectrum respond to the calm, clear, consistent interactions that robotics
                  can provide.

                <li>Programmers are in high demand which both robotics and coding provide leverage on
                  Effective Way of Introducing Programming to Students Programming can be too abstract. By having to
                  control a
                  physical robot and seeing what goes wrong, students learn what robots can and can’t do. They also
                  learn the need for
                  precise instructions. Robotics and coding helps address the growing demand for teaching science,
                  technology,
                  engineering and math in schools, and how this subjects link together.</li>

                <li class="bg-danger">Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships,
                  and jobs while
                  robotics on the
                  other hands provide artificial support in getting job done
                  If you possess a hot skill that many of your peers lack–such as the ability to code–you instantly
                  appear more
                  desirable in the eyes of potential college admissions officers and employers. Plain and simple.</li>


                <li>With programming knowledge, students better understand the world around them.
                  Most of us don’t know the first thing about what makes our smartphones, laptops, social media
                  networks, and video
                  games run.
                  Basic programming knowledge can change the way we interact with the technologies we use (and take
                  for
                  granted) daily
                  and can open our eyes to the infinite possibilities of coding.</li>

                <li class="bg-warning">Robotics and Programming is fun and satisfying.
                  While programming is logic-based, it’s also an extremely creative activity. If you know how to code,
                  you can develop
                  apps, video games, websites, and more!
                  5. Robotics and Coding improves creativity.
                  Robot building is wide and involves a lot of engineering works, while coding help you to learn a
                  language, you use
                  it to express yourself. The same is true with code. Coding empowers kids to not only consume digital
                  media and
                  technology, but to create it. Instead of simply playing a video game or using an app, they can
                  imagine
                  making their
                  own video game or envision what their own website, or app might look like—and they’ll have the
                  outlet
                  for
                  expression.</li>

                <li>Both robotics and Coding improves problem solving.
                  When kids code, they take complex problems and break them down into smaller parts. Kids learn what
                  it’s like to
                  approach a problem the way a software engineer does, with logical, computational thinking. This
                  logical thinking is
                  a powerful tool in school, work, and life.</li>

                <li>Coding with robotics also improves persistence.
                  Learning to code, like any new discipline, is a challenge. Thus, tackling complex problems—and
                  making
                  mistakes along
                  the way—can be very frustrating. Both teach the valuable skill of persistence in the face of such
                  challenges.
                  Learning how to problem solve and look for solutions through research and collaboration builds this
                  highly desirable skill.</li>

                <li>Coding improves collaboration.
                  Anyone can learn how to code—kids can learn alongside others of every race, gender, or background.
                  Kids meet and
                  learn how to collaborate with all kinds of peers, all joined by a common interest in technology.
                  Classrooms and other in-person environments, like Homestead Technologies, bring kids together for
                  face-to-face
                  collaboration.</li>

                <li class="bg-danger">Coding improves communication.
                  Communication is an absolutely essential skill throughout school, work, and life. People who can
                  clearly communicate
                  complex ideas in simple terms tend to be successful in different industries and walks of life. When
                  kids learn how
                  to code, they learn how to communicate with the most simple-minded audience imaginable: computers.
                  As
                  mentioned,
                  coding teaches kids how to break down complex ideas and arrange them in a way that computers can
                  understand.</li>
