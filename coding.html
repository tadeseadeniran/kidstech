  <p> Coding for kids refers to the collection of opportunities available for children to get
    involved in coding. While it might be difficult to imagine a young mind learning something so seemingly complex, it
    is
    definitely an attainable reality.
    On the most basic level, coding is how we communicate with computers, and what we use to build and run websites,
    apps,
    video games, and more. Learning to code is like learning how to speak and write in a particular language; a
    computer’s
    language. It gets pupils/students familiar with how things work.

  <p>Advantanges of kids participate in coding class can not be over emphasised;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programmers are in high demand which both robotics and coding provide leverage on
      Effective Way of Introducing Programming to Students Programming can be too abstract. By having to control a
      physical robot and seeing what goes wrong, students learn what robots can and can’t do. They also learn the need
      for precise instructions. Robotics and coding helps address the growing demand for teaching science, technology,
      engineering and math in schools, and how this subjects link together.
    </li>
    <li>Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships, and jobs while robotics on the
      other hands provide artificial support in getting job done
      If you possess a hot skill that many of your peers lack–such as the ability to code–you instantly appear more
      desirable in the eyes of potential college admissions officers and employers. Plain and simple.
    </li>
    <li>With programming knowledge, students better understand the world around them.
      Most of us don’t know the first thing about what makes our smartphones, laptops, social media networks, and video
      games run.
    </li>
    <li>Basic programming knowledge can change the way we interact with the technologies we use (and take for granted)
      daily and can open our eyes to the infinite possibilities of coding.</li>
    <li>Programming is fun and satisfying.
      While programming is logic-based, it’s also an extremely creative activity. If you know how to code, you can
      develop apps, video games, websites, and more!
